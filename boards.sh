# The board configurations a release covers.
#
# Sourced by buildAll.sh and release-notes.sh so the built artifacts and the
# "what do I flash?" table in the release notes cannot drift apart.
#
# Each board has a <tag>_cflags.h header and a <tag>-build*.sh script family.
# Only the standalone variants are released here: the pico-bootLoader variants
# (<tag>-build-forbootloader.sh) are built in the pico-bootLoader repo, which
# invokes those scripts itself.

# Where the WAD data (doom1.whx) is flashed by the standalone builds. Must match
# the non-BUILD_FOR_BOOTLOADER branch of TINY_WAD_ADDR in every <tag>_cflags.h,
# which is the same offset on all five boards.
#
# The pico-bootLoader builds use one other offset, 0x10200000 behind their 1.5 MB
# app slot, the same on all five boards. That WHX is not released from this
# repository: the pico-bootLoader repo builds those variants, WHX included, and
# its updateAll converts doom1.whx at that offset itself.
